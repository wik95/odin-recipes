# odin-recipes

The odin-recipes project, is the first project that I got to work on, on my TOP journey so far. It's a basic recipe website containing three different recipes. 

During this specific project I got a chance to work on general HTML skill such as the HTML boilerplate, ordered and unordered lists, adding links and images as well as commiting everything to GitHub.
