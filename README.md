# odin-recipes

Well, I'm about to start my first official TOP project, where I'm supposed to create a recipe website. I'll try to add more information here at the end of the project to summarize everything I've learned during the project. 

#still not sure if I should update the readme file through VCstudio or directly on GitHub
