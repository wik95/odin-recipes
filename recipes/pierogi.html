    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Pierogi (the word 'pierogi'is plural in Polish, 
    the singular is one 'pieróg' - pronounced pye-ROOG) 
    are the most recognizable Polish food abroad. They are 
    half-circular dumplings usually made from noodle flour dough, 
    and sometimes from pastry dough. Pierogi are stuffed in a similar 
    fashion to many other types of dumplings, for example the Japanese
    gyoza or the Italian ravioli.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <h4>Potato Filling:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 cups cold mashed potatoes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Dough:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container sour cream</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <1i>¼ teaspoon salt</1i>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the sauerkraut filling: Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and fry them until they become translucent, for about 5 minutes. Add the sauerkraut, keep stirring occasionally, for 5 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then place it on a plate to cool.</li>
        <li>Prepare the potato filling: Melt the butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Add the onions. Cook and stir the onions until translucent, for about 5 minutes. Then add the mashed potatoes, salt, and white pepper.</li>
        <li>Make the dough: Beat the sour cream and eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl; combine the dry ingridients with sour cream mixture until everything comes together. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until firm and smooth.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough in half, then roll out one half to about an 1/8-inch thickness. Cut into 3-inch circles using a biscuit cutter. Place a small spoonful of potato filling into the center of each circle. Moisten the edges with water, fold over, and press the edges together with a fork to seal. Repeat the steps with the rest of the dough and the sauerkraut filling.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pierogies in batches into the boiling water and cook until they float up to the top, for about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
